	<h1> Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>

	<p>
		The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you approach the equator. To conduct our analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. 

		After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs latitude. We looked at four different factors: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analyis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
